\title{Calculates Signal Detection Theory indices.}
\usage{
dprime(n_hit, n_miss, n_fa, n_cr)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_hit}{Number of hits.}

\item{n_miss}{Number of misses.}

\item{n_fa}{Number of false alarms.}

\item{n_cr}{Number of correct rejections.}
}
\description{
Calculates the d', the beta, the A' and the B''D based on the
signal detection theory (SRT). See Pallier (2002) for the algorithms.
}
\value{
A list containing 4 objects.
\item{dprime}{The d'. d' reflects the distance between the two distributions: signal, and signal+noise and corresponds to the Z value of the hit-rate minus that of the false-alarm rate.}

\item{beta}{The beta. The value for beta is the ratio of the normal density functions at the criterion of the Z values used in the computation of d'. This reflects an observer's bias to say 'yes' or 'no' with the unbiased observer having a value around 1.0. As the bias to say 'yes' increases, resulting in a higher hit-rate and false-alarm-rate, beta approaches 0.0. As the bias to say 'no' increases, resulting in a lower hit-rate and false-alarm rate, beta increases over 1.0 on an open-ended scale.}

\item{aprime}{The A'. Non-parametric estimate of discriminability. An A' near 1.0 indicates good discriminability, while a value near 0.5 means chance performance.}

\item{bppd}{The B''D. Non-parametric estimate of bias. A B''D equal to 0.0 indicates no bias, positive numbers represent conservative bias (i.e. a tendency to answer 'no'), negative numbers represent liberal bias (i.e. a tendency to answer 'yes'). The maximum absolute value is 1.0.}

\item{c}{The Criterion. the number of standard deviations from the midpoint between these two distributions, i.e. a measure on a continuum from "conservative" to "liberal".}
}
            
\details{
For d' and beta, adjustement for extreme values are made following the recommandations Hautus (1995).
